# Java Console Calculator

A simple Java console-based calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations.  
Designed for beginners or anyone who needs a lightweight tool to do quick calculations via the terminal.

## Why this project is useful

- **Educational**: Demonstrates basic Java programming conceptsâ€”methods, user input with `Scanner`, exception handling, control flow (loops and switches), and input validation.
- **Lightweight tool**: Runs in any terminal/console without GUI dependencies; useful for quick arithmetic without opening a full calculator app.
- **Extendable**: Serves as a foundation for adding more features (history, scientific functions, expression parsing, GUI front-end, etc.).

## Features

- Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division.
- Handles invalid menu choices and non-numeric input gracefully.
- Prevents division by zero.
- Interactive loop: allows multiple calculations until the user chooses to exit.
